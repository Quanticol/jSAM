FlyFast is an on-the-fly mean field probabilistic model checker. Its purpose is the automatic verification of time-bounded PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic) properties of a *selected individual* in the context of systems that consist of a *large number* of (similar, but) independent, *interacting objects*.
